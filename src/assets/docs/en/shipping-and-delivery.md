# Shipping & Delivery

Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange.  

To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.  

Several types of goods are exempt from being returned. Perishable goods such as food, flowers, newspapers or magazines cannot be returned. We also do not accept products that are hazardous materials, or flammable liquids or gases.  

Additional non-returnable items include:
- Gift cards  
- Downloadable software products  
- Some health and personal care items  

To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.  

Do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer.


#### Refunds (if applicable)

Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.  

If approved, your refund will be processed and automatically applied to your credit card or original payment method within a certain number of days.  

Late or missing refunds (if applicable):  
- Check your bank account again.  
- Then contact your credit card company. It may take some time before your refund is officially posted.  
- Next contact your bank. There is often processing time before a refund is posted.
